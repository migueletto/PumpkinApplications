To warp through a wormhole you have to pay wormhole taxes, which depend on the type of your ship. The \"Current Costs\" item indicates what you have to pay your mercenaries, the current system as wormhole tax, the bank as interest on a loan and the bank as insurance, before you can warp. \r\rIf the system isn\'t out of range, you can warp to it by tapping the Warp button. If the system is out of range, or if you decide you don\'t want to warp, you can get to other options through the menu, or you can immediately return to the Short Range Chart by tapping the appropriate button. You can also view the average price list for the target system by tapping the Average Price List button.\r\rThe arrows in the top right area of the screen can be used to scroll through the systems which are within range.\r"

STRING ID GalacticChartString "Tapping a system on the galactic chart shows information on that system at the bottom of the screen. Tapping on a wormhole will display a line indicating the system to which the wormhole goes, as well as the name of both systems.\r\r Tapping a system twice will cause that system to be tracked, which will be indicated with an \"X\". On the Short-Range chart, an arrow will indicate the direction to the tracked system. Tapping on a tracked system will turn off tracking.\r\r On color Palms, systems you have already visited are blue, unvisited systems are green, and wormholes are red. On grayscale Palms, visited systems are slightly lighter than unvisited systems, and wormholes are very light. On monochrome Palms, systems you have already visited are black, unvisited systems are \"open\" circles, and wormholes are small crosses.\r\r You can alphabetically scroll through the systems by using the PalmPilot Scroll button.\r\rThe Find button allows you to enter a system name, on which the chart will then focus; you also have the option to track the system."

STRING ID SystemInformationString "This screen shows information on the system where you are currently docked. You can click on the News button to buy a newspaper, which will have headlines about local and nearby events. If there is a Special button visible, tap it to get a special offer, only available in this system. If there is a mercenary available in this system, a Mercenary For Hire button is visible. Tapping it will take you to the Personnel Roster."

STRING ID ConfirmNewString "Starting a new game will erase all data on your current game."

STRING ID MoreSkillPointsString "You have 20 skill points to divide over the four commander skills. You should award them all."

STRING ID BuyCargoString "Use this screen to buy cargo. The leftmost column shows quantities available. The second column shows the name of the goods. The fourth column shows the price. To buy goods, either tap the quantity cell, after which you can specify how much you want to buy, or tap the \"Max\" cell, which will automatically buy the maximum number of items, limited by the quantity available, the number of empty cargo holds you have, and your cash position. If you have \"Reserve Money\" checked in the Options menu, the game will reserve at least enough money to pay for insurance and mercenaries."

STRING ID SellCargoString "Use this screen to sell cargo. The leftmost column shows quantities you have stored in your cargo holds. The second column shows the name of the goods. If the name of the goods is in bold, it means you can sell these goods with a profit. The fourth column shows the price you can get for your goods. To sell, either tap the quantity cell, after which you can specify how much you want to sell, or tap the \"All\" cell, which will automatically sell all goods you own of the selected item.\r\rIf there is no trade in a particular item, you can dump it using the \"Dump\" button. You will be charged a disposal fee per item dumped.\r\rNote that criminals receive less for their goods, since they can\'t sell goods directly: they have to use an intermediary whom they have to pay 10%. This is already accounted for in the quoted price, but it\'s good to know that you could have made a better sale if you had only been a bit more careful. The Commander Status screen shows whether or not you are considered to be a criminal."

STRING ID NothingAvailableString "On the Buy Cargo screen, the button to the left of the goods displays the amount available. If the amount is zero, none of these goods are available."

STRING ID CantAffordString "At the bottom of the Buy Cargo screen, you see the credits you have available. You don\'t seem to have enough to buy at least one of the selected items. If you have \"Reserve Money\" checked in the Options menu, the game will reserve at least enough money to pay for insurance and mercenaries."

STRING ID NoEmptyBaysString "On the screen where you can get the cargo, you see the number of cargo bays that are full, and the total number of cargo bays available. If these are equal, you don\'t have room for more goods. If in the options menu you have specified that you want to reserve some cargo bays for storing goods you acquire during flight, this is taken into account."

STRING ID AmountToBuyString "Specify the amount to buy and tap the OK button. If you specify more than there is available, or than you can afford, or than your cargo bays can hold, the maximum possible amount will be bought. The same goes if you tap the All button. If you don\'t want to buy anything, tap the None button."

STRING ID NothingForSaleString "On the Sell Cargo screen, the leftmost button shows the number of cargo bays you have which contain these goods. If that amount is zero, you can\'t sell anything."

STRING ID AmountToSellString "If you are selling items, specify the amount to sell and tap the OK button. If you specify more than you have in your cargo bays, the maximum possible amount will be sold. The same goes if you tap the All button. If you don\'t want to sell anything, tap the None button.\r\rSimilarly, if you are dumping items, specify the amount to sell and tap the OK button. If you specify more than you have in your cargo bays, all of them will be dumped. The same goes if you tap the All button. If you don\'t want to dump anything, tap the None button."

STRING ID ShipYardString "At the Ship Yard, you can buy fuel, get your hull repaired, buy an escape pod, or even buy a new ship. When you buy a new ship, the total worth of your current ship (including equipment and cargo) is subtracted from the price of a new ship.\r\rAn escape pod will automatically eject you and your crew from your ship when it gets destroyed.\r\rIf you want to automatically buy a full tank and/or automatically get a full hull repair when you dock at a new system, you can check the appropriate options in the Options menu, available through the game menu.\r\rWhen buying a new ship or an escape pod, if you have \"Reserve Money\" checked in the Options menu, the game will reserve at least enough money to pay for insurance and mercenaries."

STRING ID BuyFuelString "Enter the amount of credits you wish to spend on fuel and tap OK. If you tap Maximum, as much as needed for a full tank will be spent, up to your total amount of cash. If you tap Nothing, you won\'t buy fuel."

STRING ID BuyRepairsString "Enter the amount of credits you wish to spend on repairs and tap OK. If you tap Maximum, as much as needed for full repairs will be spent, up to your total amount of cash. If you tap Nothing, you won\'t buy any repairs."

STRING ID NotInterestedString "Notice that on the Sell Cargo screen, it says \"no trade\" next to these goods. This means that people aren\'t interested in buying them, either because of their political system, or because their tech level isn\'t high enough to make use of them."

STRING ID BuyShipString "Information on a ship type you can get buy tapping the Info button to the right of it. Buy a new ship by tapping the corresponding Buy button. The price quoted for the ship takes into account the discount you get for trading in your current ship, including its  equipment and cargo. The ship delivered to you will lack any equipment and cargo. Note that if you are carrying cargo which the current system isn\'t interested in, you lose that cargo also without receiving any compensation for it.\r\rIf you have an escape pod it will be transferred to your new ship. Insurance will also be transferred, including your no-claim.\r\rIf you have \"Reserve Money\" checked in the Options menu, the game will reserve at least enough money to pay for insurance and mercenaries."

STRING ID TradeShipString "If you say Yes, you lose your current ship, including equipment and cargo, and get a brand new ship of the indicated type, without equipment and cargo."

STRING ID TooManyCrewmembersString "The information on a ship will show how many crew quarters it has. If there are enough to hold your current crew, they will simply be transferred to the new ship. Otherwise you have to fire as many of them as needed, before you can buy a new ship."

STRING ID ShiptypeInfoString "The Ship Information screen shows the specs of the selected ship type. You can return to the Buy Ship screen by tapping the button at the bottom of the screen. "

STRING ID CantBuyShipString "The ship\'s price takes into account the trade-in value of your current ship. You have to pay the remaining price with your cash total. If you have \"Reserve Money\" checked in the Options menu, the game will reserve at least enough money to pay for insurance and mercenaries."

STRING ID BuyEquipmentString "Tap the Buy button to the left of a piece of equipment to buy it for the price to the right of it. Note that each ship type can only carry a limited number of items in each equipment category. \r\rThe three categories are weapons, shields and gadgets. The weapons category contains the three types of lasers, the shields category contains the two types of shields, and the gadget category contains the following gadgets: 1) 5 extra cargo bays; 2)  auto-repair system (which helps your engineering functions); 3) navigating system (which helps you pilot your ship); 4) targeting system (which helps you fighting); and 5) cloaking device (which allows you to travel undetected, unless you attack yourself or your opponent has a better engineer than you).\r\rIf you have \"Reserve Money\" checked in the Options menu, the game will reserve at least enough money to pay for insurance and mercenaries."

STRING ID SellEquipmentString "To sell a piece of equipment for the price indicated to the right of it, tap the Sell button to the left of it."

STRING ID CantBuyItemString "If you can\'t pay the price mentioned to the right of an item, you can\'t get it. If you have \"Reserve Money\" checked in the Options menu, the game will reserve at least enough money to pay for insurance and mercenaries."

STRING ID NotEnoughSlotsString "For each item type, each ship type has only a limited number of slots available. If you really want to buy the specified item, you have to empty a slot of this item type buy selling an item of the same type. Some ships don\'t have any slots of certain types."

STRING ID NoMoreOfItemString "Except for extra cargo bays, of the available gadgets you only need to buy one: a second one isn\'t of any use."

STRING ID ItemNotSoldString "Each item is only available in a system which has the technological development needed to produce it."

STRING ID CargoBaysFullString "First you need to sell some trade goods. When you have at least 5 empty bays, you can sell the extra cargo bays."

STRING ID PersonnelRosterString "On the Personnel Roster screen, there are three areas. The upper two are reserved for mercenaries in your service. If you have hired someone, he or she is visible in one of these areas. To fire someone in your service, just tap the corresponding Fire button.\r\rThe bottom area is reserved for a mercenary who is for hire in the current system. To hire him or her, just tap the Hire button. Note that if you fire someone, he or she will probably decide to return to his or her home system."

STRING ID NoFreeQuartersString "If you hire someone, you must give him or her quarters on your ship. Depending on the type of ship, you can hire zero, one or two mercenaries."

STRING ID SpecialEventString "In a special meeting, you can do something unique to this system. Usually this is a special offer or an assignment. \r\rIf it is an offer you have to agree to, there are a Yes and a No button visible. Tap Yes to accept the offer, tap No to return to the System Information screen. As long as you don\'t accept the special offer, it will remain available in this system. \r\rNote that the special offer \"Moon For Sale\" will allow you to win the game if you accept it."

STRING ID NotEnoughForEventString "If you don\'t have enough credits to agree to accept an offer, you\'ll have to wait until you have amassed enough money and then return. If you have \"Reserve Money\" checked in the Options menu, the game will reserve at least enough money to pay for insurance and mercenaries."

STRING ID MustPayMercenariesString "You must pay your mercenaries daily, that is, before you warp to another system. If you don\'t have the cash, you must either sell something so you have enough cash, or fire the mercenaries you can\'t pay. Until then, warping is out of the question."

STRING ID TribblesAteFoodString "Alas, tribbles are hungry and fast-multiplying animals. You shouldn\'t expect to be able to hold them out of your cargo bays. You should find a way to get rid of them."

STRING ID YouHaveATribbleString "The merchant prince sold you a cute, furry tribble. You can see your new acquisition on the Commander Status screen."

STRING ID BeamOverTribblesString "No more tribbles!"

STRING ID SkillIncreaseString "On the Commander Status screen you can see your new skill values."

STRING ID CleanRecordString "With a clean police record, the police will usually let you slip by without searching your ship. Also, if you were a criminal before, you can now sell you goods again for full prices."

STRING ID CommanderStatusString "On the Commander Status screen you can examine your skills, your reputation and your total worth. Note that if your police record indicates that you are a criminal or worse, you have to use an intermediary to sell goods, who charges 10 percent of the selling price for his services. The numbers within brackets with the skills are the skill values which take into account mercenaries and equipment on your ship.\r\rThe Ship button allows you to examine your current ship. The Quests button allows you to see details on the quests you are currently on."

STRING ID OptionsString "\"Always ignore when it is safe\" will fly past encounters where you can safely ignore your opponent. This means you won\'t encounter any peaceful ships along the way. You also won\'t see ships which immediately start to flee from you, and neither will you see any ships which ignore you because you have a cloaking device. You can set this option separately for police, pirates,  traders, and traders wanting to make deals in orbit. As long as you play as a peaceful trader, you can check the first three, but you might want to make sure the fourth is unchecked. When you become a bounty hunter, you should uncheck the \"pirates\" one. When you become a pirate, you should uncheck the \"traders\" one. If you want to attack everybody and anybody (in other words, when you are a real evil psychopath), you should uncheck all four.\r\r\"Get full tank on arrival\", if checked, will automatically get a full tank of fuel when docking at a new system, if, of course, you have enough credits. \r\r\"Get full hull repair on arrival\" will automatically get your hull repaired to 100% when docking at a new system, if, of course, you have enough credits. \r\r\"Reserve money for warp costs\" will not spend all your money when buying cargo, equipment or a new ship, but will reserve at least enough to pay your mercenaries and insurance. It won\'t take into account interest, because your debt will simply increase if you can\'t pay interest, and it won\'t take into account wormhole tax, because it\'s not known whether or not you will fly through a wormhole. It also won\'t protect you when buying fuel or repairs.\r\r\"Always go from Chart to Info\", if checked, will always present the target system Info screen when you tap that system on the Short Range Chart. If not checked, the game will remember whether you were last on the Info screen or on the Average Price List, and will go to the screen you last accessed (if you are allowed to go to that screen).\r\r\"Continuous attack and flight\" automatically executes, once started, an attack or an attempt to flee every second, until either the player chooses a new action, or one of the ships gets destroyed, or one of the ships manages to escape, or the opponent changes his attitude (for instance, switches from attacking to fleeing or surrendering). You can also interrupt the repetition by tapping the \"Int.\" button or by simply selecting another action.\r\r\"Continue attacking fleeing ship\", if checked, will automatically continue the automatic attack, if it is activated, on a ship that stops attacking you and starts fleeing.\r\r\"Cargo bays to leave empty\" is the number of cargo bays you want to leave empty when buying trade goods. This is useful if you like to use the \"Max\" button but still would like to leave some bays empty in case you can pick up cargo while flying to another system.\r\rClick \"Done\" when you\'re done, or \"More...\" for other options.\r\r"

STRING ID AveragePricesString "This screen shows the average prices you get for goods in the target system. If the trade good is shown in a bold font, it means the average price mentioned here is better than the buying price in the current system. \r\rNote that these prices do take into account the system size, government and tech level. Special resources (like rich soil) are also taken into account if you know about them. Special situations (like war) are temporary and are therefore not taken into account. \r\rRemember that criminals can\'t sell their goods directly, but have to use an intermediary, who keeps 10 percent of the selling price for himself. This is also not taken into account in the calculation of the average prices. \r\rThe button \"Price Differences\" switches to an overview of the differences between the average prices in the target system and the buying prices in the current system. When price differences are shown, this button is replaced by an \"Absolute Prices\" button, which, if tapped, will switch back to absolute prices.\r\rThe buttons labeled \"<\" and \">\" can be used to scroll through the systems which are within range.\r\rTo return to the target system information screen, tap the System Information button and to return to the short range chart, tap the Shot Range Chart button. You can also immediately go into warp by tapping the Warp button."

STRING ID BankString "At the bank you can get a loan, if you are really in need of cash. As long as your police record is at least clean, you can have a loan of at least 1000 credits, more if you are rich yourself. When you don\'t have a clean police record, the bank will maximally lend you 500 credits.\r\rWhen your debt is more than the amount the bank is willing to lend you, you won\'t get a new loan. There is an interest of 10% to be paid daily, which will be subtracted from your cash right before you warp to another system. If you don\'t have enough cash, this will simply add to your debt. Settle your debts as quickly as possible, because as long as you have debts, you won\'t be able to buy a new ship or new equipment for your ship.\r\rAt the bank, you can also buy insurance for your ship. This is only useful if you also have an escape pod on your ship, because the insurance pays out when your ship gets destroyed and you manage to escape in a pod. The cost of the insurance is to be paid daily: 0.25 percent of the trade-in value of your current ship, including its equipment (but excluding cargo). For each day you fly without claim, 1% is subtracted from the amount to be paid. Note that if you stop your insurance, your \"no claim\" returns to zero percent. Also note that if the trade-in value of your ship changes, your insurance costs also change."

STRING ID YoureInDebtString "Before you can buy a new ship or new equipment, you must settle your debts at the bank."

STRING ID GetLoanString "As long as your debt is below the amount the bank is willing to lend you, you can get a loan up to that amount. There is a 10% interest to be paid each day, until you have paid back your loan. The interest will be automatically subtracted from your cash. If you don\'t have the cash, it will be added to your loan. As long as you are in debt, you can\'t buy equipment and you can\'t trade in your ship for a more expensive ship."

STRING ID PayBackString "Pay back your loan by specifying an amount and tapping OK. You will never pay back more than your actual debt."

STRING ID DebtTooHighString "You can\'t get a loan if your debt exceeds what the bank is willing to lend you."

STRING ID NoDebtString "You don\'t need to pay back anything if you have no debts. Be happy."

STRING ID EncounterString "When you encounter another ship, your and your opponent\'s stats are shown at the top of the encounter screen. When in pure text mode (you can set this in the Options menu), you see percentages indicating the hull and shield strength of both ships. When in graphical mode, these stats are visualized. The percentage of a ship that is colored red, indicates how much the hull is weakened. When a ship is colored red completely, its hull is (almost) gone. The shield strength is indicated by the size of the shield that surrounds a ship. Your own ship is shown to the left, and your opponent\'s ship is shown to the right. The icon in the upper right corner shows who your opponent is: a skull indicates a pirate, a badge indicates a police ship and a coin indicates a trader.\r\rIn an encounter with another ship, there are several options:\r\rA trader won\'t attack you, but if you attack, might fight back, flee, or surrender. If it surrenders, you can steal from its cargo. In a fight with a trader, if it goes bad for you, you might try to flee.\r\rAn encounter with a pirate goes along the same lines as an encounter with a trader, except that a pirate will probably attack you on sight and will never surrender.\r\rAn encounter with a police ship is different. They may choose to ignore you, or ask you to submit to inspection. If you are a known criminal, they might attack you on sight. If you submit to inspection and are carrying illegal goods (firearms or narcotics), these goods will be impounded and you will be fined. Your reputation will suffer, but just a little. However, instead of submitting to inspection, you may try to bribe the police. You can also flee from them or attack them, of course, in which case the ensuing fight resembles the fight with a pirate. Fleeing from the police will immediately set your record to \"dubious\", and attacking, of course, will make you a criminal without further ado. Surrendering to the police will cost you a hefty fine and some time in jail.\r\rIf you check the option \"Automatic attack and flight\" in the Options screen, after you tapped \"Attack\" or \"Flee\" this action will be repeated every second, until the opponent changes his attitude. During that time, a button marked \"Int.\" (for Interrupt) will be shown in the bottom right corner of the Encounter screen. If you tap this button, the repetition will be interrupted. However, it is also possible to simply tap on another button to change actions. To show you that the action is still continuing a blinking spot is shown right next to the \"Int.\" button. \r\rSometimes you will have a special encounter with another ship.\r\rIn a special encounter with another ship, there are several options:\r\rIf you ignore a ship in a special encounter, you will continue on your journey and will have no further interaction with the ship.\r\rIn a special encounter, you may engage the other ship. While the exact nature of the engagement will vary (depending on the encounter), this will usually present you with some opportunity. You will always have an option to accept or decline any opportunity that such an encounter may present.\r \rBecause these encounters are out of the ordinary,  the option \"Automatic attack and flight\" from the Options screen is ignored.\r"

STRING ID UneventfulTripString "Be glad you didn\'t encounter any pirates."

STRING ID ArrivalString "Another trip you have survived."

STRING ID IllegalGoodsString "Firearms and narcotics are illegal goods, and you lose these. You are fined a percentage of your total worth. This is subtracted from your credits. If you don\'t have enough credits, it increases your debt."

STRING ID NoIllegalGoodsString "Firearms and narcotics are illegal goods. Since you don\'t carry these, the police have no problems with you."

STRING ID BribeString "If the police officers can be bribed, it depends on the type of government of the target system how much it\'s going to cost you. If you pay the bribe, the police will forego inspection and you can continue your way. It\'s only useful to bribe if you are carrying illegal goods, that is, firearms or narcotics. You can only offer a bribe if you have enough cash."

STRING ID CantBeBribedString "Certain governments have such an incorruptible police force that you can\'t bribe them."

STRING ID NoMoneyForBribeString "You can only use your cash to pay a bribe; you can\'t trade your goods and you can\'t get a loan to pay the police off."

STRING ID PiratesPlunderString "The pirates steal from you what they can carry, but at least you get out of it alive."

STRING ID PiratesFindNoCargoString "If you have nothing in your cargo holds, the pirates will blow up your ship unless you pay them some money, equal to 5% of your current worth, which will be subtracted from your cash, unless you don\'t have enough of that, in which case it will be added to your debt. At least it\'s better than dying."

STRING ID BothDestroyedString "The game is over, alas."

STRING ID OpponentDestroyedString "You won the fight."

STRING ID ShipDestroyedString "The game is over, alas."

STRING ID YouEscapedString "You continue your flight towards the target system."

STRING ID OpponentEscapedString "Your opponent has flown. You can\'t destroy him any longer, or try to plunder him."

STRING ID RetireString "If you retire, the game ends. You sell your ship and everything on it, and remain in the current system for the rest of your days. If applicable, your total worth will be entered in the high score table."

STRING ID BountyString "Destroying a pirate ship awards you bounty money. The height of the sum depends on the type of ship destroyed. The reward is automatically added to your cash."

STRING ID PlunderString "You are allowed to plunder your opponent\'s cargo to your heart\'s content. Just steal whatever is to your liking. This works exactly as the Buy Cargo option when you are docked, except that you don\'t have to pay anything. You are, of course, limited to the amount your own cargo bays can hold. If you holds are already full, you can jettison selections from your cargo into space by tapping the Dump button. Tap the Done button when you are finished."

STRING ID NotEnoughBaysString "You should sell enough goods so that you have enough empty cargo bays available."

STRING ID AntidoteString "You can\'t use these ten cargo bays until you have visited the Japori system and delivered them there. Note that you can\'t even get rid of them by selling your ship."

STRING ID LightningShieldString "The lightning shield is a shield with a lot more power than the usual shields. This shield can be sold, but note that if you sell the shield, there is no way to get another one, since it is an experimental shield and not commonly available. If you upgrade ships, you can pay to have the shield installed in your new ship."

STRING ID SealedCannistersString "On the Sell Cargo screen you can see what you bought."

STRING ID AmountToPlunderString "You can steal the amount you like, as long as it fits in your cargo bays. Tap Maximum to get as much as possible. Tap Nothing to return to the Plunder screen."

STRING ID VictimDoesntHaveAnyString "You can only steal what your victim actually has."

STRING ID FindSystemString "Type in the name of the system you are looking for and click OK. The search is case insensitive. Selecting \"Track this System\" will cause a arrow to be shown in the Short Range chart, pointing in the direction of the system you are looking for."

STRING ID NoFullTanksString "You have checked the automatic buying of full fuel tanks in the Options menu, but you don\'t have enough money to buy those tanks. Don\'t forget to buy them as soon as you have made some money."

STRING ID NoFullRepairsString "You have automatic full hull repairs checked in the Options menu, but you don\'t have the money for that. If you still want the repairs, don\'t forget to make them before you leave the system."

STRING ID NoFullTanksOrRepairsString "In the Options menu you have indicated that you wish to buy full tanks and full hull repairs automatically when you arrive in a new system, but you don\'t have the money for that. At least make sure that you buy full tanks after you have made some money."

STRING ID HighScoreString "Your score, calculated from the way you ended the game, your total worth, and the number of days you played, is entered automatically in the high score table when you qualify. You do NOT qualify if you laded a savegame while playing the game."

STRING ID HighScoreTableString "This screen shows the high scores. The scoring percentage is calculated as follows: if you retired through the menu, your score is your total worth / 25000, minus 5%. If you got killed, your score is calculated in the same way, except that 10% is deducted instead of 5%. If you won the game by claiming your own moon, your score is calculated by adding 100 times the difficulty level (beginner=1, impossible=5), minus the number of days played, multiplied by 1000, to your total worth. That amount is divided by 25000 to get your score. The moon is included in your total worth. One extra thing to notice is that if your total worth exceeds 1 million, every credit over 1 million counts for only 0.1 credit."

STRING ID ClearTableString "If you clear the high score table, your next score is certain to get entered. It\'s a bit of a cowardly option, though."

STRING ID HowToPlayString "Space Trader is a strategy game in which the ultimate goal is to make enough cash to buy your own moon, to which you can retire. The most straightforward way to make cash is to trade goods between solar systems, hopefully making a profit. However, you can also decide to become a pirate and rob innocent traders of their wares. You can also earn an income by bounty hunting.\r\rInformation on the game can be found in the documentation file which comes with it. The Help menu in the game offers basic information, enough to play the game. The menu choice Help Current Screen always gives information on the screen which is currently shown. The rest of the menu choices give a basic overview of the game, of which this particular text is the first. The First Steps choice is especially interesting for a first-time player, since it describes all the steps you need to perform your first days as a trader.\r\rYou have to change screens often. All main screens are accessible through the menu. Shortcut keys are provided for the major choices, and you are advised to use them. To make that easier, you don\'t even have to provide the shortcut-stroke: just write the character associated with the menu and it will be activated. The four choices you have to use the most (Buy Cargo, Sell Cargo, Ship Yard and Short Range Chart) have their own shortcut button at the top right corner of every screen. These shortcut functions can be changed from the Shortcuts menu option in the Game menu.\r\rAt the start of the game you have a small spaceship of the Gnat type, armed with a simple pulse laser, and 1000 credits to start your ventures. While docked, you can buy or sell trade goods; buy or sell equipment for your ship; buy fuel, repairs or even a new ship at the Ship Yard; hire mercenaries; visit the bank to get a loan; get information on your status, the galaxy or nearby solar systems; and activate the warp to another system.\r\rWhen you have activated the warp, you materialise nearby the target system you selected. The last distance you have to travel on your impulse engines. During that time, you may encounter pirates, police ships, or other traders."

STRING ID TradingString "Trading is the safest way to make money. You trade by buying goods at one solar system, and sell them at another solar system. Of course, you should try to make a profit. There are several ways to ensure you can indeed sell your goods for a higher price than you bought them.\r\rThe prices a system pays for goods are determined by several factors. First and foremost, there is the tech level of a system. Low-tech systems have relatively cheap natural resources (water, furs, food and ore), while high-tech systems have relatively cheap non-natural goods. In general, prices for natural goods increase with the level of technological development, while the other prices decrease. Note that the tech level also influences which goods are useful to the inhabitants of a system, and which they won\'t buy at all.\r \rOther influences are the type of government a system has (for instance, in an anarchy there is almost always a food shortage and a military state will never buy narcotics), the size of a system (the smaller the system, the greater the demand for imported goods), and extraordinary natural resources (or the lack of them). Lastly, special events may have a tremendous influence on prices: for instance, when a system is visited by a cold spell, furs are especially in high demand.\r\rOn the Short Range Chart, you can tap a system and ask for the Average Price List for that system. This list only takes into account the size, tech level and government of a system (and the special resources if you know about them), but may be a good indication on what price you can expect to get for your goods.\r\rNote that if you are a criminal (or worse), you have to use an intermediary to sell your goods, and this intermediary will take 10% of the profits."

STRING ID TravellingString "To travel to another system, go to the Short Range Chart. The system where you currently are is in the centre of the screen. The wide circle shows how far you can travel on your current fuel tanks. If the circle is absent, you probably have no fuel and you should go to the Ship Yard to buy some.\r\rWhen you tap a system that is within reach, you get shown some information on that system, and a big Warp button, with which you can activate a warp. When you tap the Warp button, you get warped to the target system. You do not materialize on the system itself, but nearby. You have to travel the last few clicks on your impulse engines (which costs no fuel - fuel is only used to warp).\r\rDuring that time, you may meet police, pirates or other traders. The chance to meet any of them is determined by the government type of the system you are flying to. If you have a weak ship, you should probably stay away from systems which have lots of pirates. \r\rPolice ships will usually let a lawful trader pass by. If they suspect you may be trafficking illegal goods (that is, firearms or narcotics), they may ask you to submit to an inspection. If you don\'t have any illegal goods on board, just comply. If you do, and you let them inspect you, they will impound your goods and fine you. If you don\'t want to submit to inspection, you can try to flee from them (in which case they will attack you), attack them, or try to bribe them.\r\rPirates will usually attack you on sight. You can also attack them, flee from them, or surrender to them. If you surrender, they will steal from your cargo bays. If you don\'t have anything in your cargo bays, they will blow up your ship unless you pay them off with cash. Destroying a pirate will earn you a bounty.\r\rTraders will usually ignore you. However, you can become a pirate yourself and attack them. Sometimes, a trader who finds you too strong an opponent and who can\'t manage to flee from you, will surrender to you and let you steal from his cargo bays.\r"

STRING ID ShipEquipmentString "There are several types of ships available to you. You start out in a Gnat, which is the cheapest ship but one (the cheapest is the Flea, which is mainly used if you need to jump over a large distance, since it can travel up to 20 parsecs on one tank). At the Ship Yard, you can buy a new ship if you like and one is available. The availability of ships depends on the tech level of the system.\r\rShip equipment falls into three groups. Each ship can equip zero or more of each group. The ship type determines exactly how many. For instance, your Gnat can equip one weapon, zero shields and one gadget. \r\rThe first group consists of weapons. Three kinds of lasers are available, and the more lasers, or the more expensive lasers you equip, the more damage you do. The second group consists of shields. Two kinds of shields are available, and the more shields, or the more expensive shields you equip, the better you are defended against attacks. The last group consists of gadgets.\r\rAs gadgets, you can buy 5 extra cargo bays, a targeting system, a navigating system, an auto-repair system, or a cloaking device. Of the extra cargo bays you can equip more than one: of the others you don\'t have use for more than one. The cloaking device helps you fly undetected through space; the other three systems increase one of your skills (see Skills).\r\rBesides equipment slots, a ship has also one, two or three crew quarters. If you have more than one, you might hire mercenaries to accompany you on your trips.\r\rFinally, at the Ship Yard you can get your ship equipped with an escape pod, and at the bank you can get your ship insured, so you get compensated when you have to use your pod.\r\rWhen you buy a new ship, you trade in your old one, including all its equipment. Don\'t worry, the price you pay for your new ship takes this into account. You may even get money for the trade. Mercenaries will stay on your ship, unless your new ship hasn\'t got enough crew quarters. In that case, you have to fire them."

STRING ID SkillsString "As a trader, you have need of several skills. You can set your skills on the New Commander screen at the start of the game.\r\rThe Pilot skill determines how well you fly your ship. Good pilots have an easier time escaping from a fight and dodging laser shots.\r\rThe Fighter skill determines how well you handle your weapons. While the actual damage you do with a weapon is solely determined by the weapon\'s power, the fighter skill determines whether you hit or not.\r\rThe Trader skill influences the price you have to pay for goods and equipment. A good trader pays considerably less than a bad trader.\r\rFinally, the Engineer skill determines how well you keep your ship in shape. Especially, an engineer manages to repair your hull and shield while traveling and during a fight. He may even reduce the damage done by an opponent to zero. A good engineer can also upgrade your weaponry a bit, so you do more damage.\r\rIf you fly a ship with extra crew quarters, you can hire mercenaries. These travel with you, for a certain sum of credits per day. The net effect of having a mercenary on board is that if the mercenary is better in a certain skill than you are, he will take over the tasks for which that skill is needed. So, if you are lacking a certain skill, a mercenary can compensate for that.\r\rAnother way to increase certain skills is to buy gadgets. Especially, a navigating system increases your pilot skill, an auto-repair system increases your engineer skill, and a targeting system increases your fighter skill."

STRING ID AcknowledgementsString "This first version of \"Space Trader\" has been designed and programmed by me, Pieter Spronck, between July and September 2000. The game has been enhanced several times since then. It has been released as freeware under a GNU General Public License (GPL).\r\rI used CodeWarrior for PalmPilot, release 6. Since it was my first project with this environment, I often consulted the example code delivered with it. I also made some use of Matt Lee\'s code for his DopeWars program.\r\rA derivative work of DopeWars was SolarWars, a program by David J. Webb. This program is very similar to DopeWars, except that it has a space trading theme instead of a drug theme. Playing SolarWars, I was reminded of the eighties game Elite. While Elite was more like a 3D space combat program, the trading between solar systems was central to it, especially because that was the best way to make money and buy better equipment for your ship.\r\rI thought it would be fun to have a program for the PalmPilot which was a trading game like SolarWars, but which would resemble the trading, development and even the combat of Elite more. Thus Space Trader was born. I haven\'t tried to hide my source of inspiration, and you\'ll find some ideas in the game which are directly derived from Elite. Consider it a tribute.\r\rA great many thanks and a lot of admiration goes out to Alexander Lawrence (al_virtual@yahoo.com), who created the beautiful pictures which illustrate the game, including the ship designs. It\'s almost worth ditching your black&white Palm for to get a color one! \r\rSam Anderson (rulez2@home.com) converted Space Trader to a multi-segmented application (version 1.1.2). Sam also made a few small changes to the code, fixing bugs and correcting grammatical errors.  I wish to extend my thanks to him for that. Without Sam, players using Palm OS versions 2.x and 4.x would have had a lot more problems with this game.\r\rSamuel Goldstein (palm@fogbound.net) added most of the new functionalities for version 1.2.0. Among these great additions are four new quests, special encounters, the \"news\", trading with fellow traders in space, better black&white pictures, and many handy new features. Samuel brought new life to this game, and even I found it to be a lot of fun again. Many heartfelt thanks go out to Samuel, from me, and I expect from many players too.\r\rDrWowe solved the irritating \"Special\" bug which plagued Space Trader for over two years. Jim Anderson sent me a solution for the \"Scarab\" bug which plagued the game even longer.\r\rMany thanks also go out to the Space Trader beta testers, who pointed out several bugs and who suggested many ideas to better the game, a lot of which have been implemented:\r\rMichael Andersson\rJohn Austin\rBen Belatrix\rLee W. Benjamin\rRussell K Bulmer (mtg101)\rChris Casperson (Neo987)\rDanny Chan\rChristophe \"The Frenchy\" Chidoyan\rLysander Destellirer\rCharles Dill\rZion A.

You were a tremendous help, and I am very grateful for that.\r\rFinally, I wish to thank all people who sent their comments to me since the first release of the game. Many of your suggestions have been incorporated in the game, and made it a lot better. Suggestions I haven\'t used, I have at least stored to inspire me when creating sequel game. Unfortunately, my life is so busy now that I have very little time to respond to emails, or even read them. \r\rAn extensive FAQ for the game is available at the Space Trader home page at http://www.spronck.net/picoverse/spacetrader."

STRING ID FirstStepsString "Here I will describe the steps you will undertake the first days as a trader:\r\rYou start by docking on some system. The specifics of that system are shown on the System Information screen. Take special note of any special resources the system might have. These influence the price you have to pay for certain goods. For instance, a system which has rich soil, usually sells food cheap, while a relatively lifeless system has little fauna and therefore expensive furs. \r\rAlso take note of any special events in the system. Special events usually means that certain things are expensive to buy, so you should stay clear from them in this system, but since special events last several days, it might be worth your while to return here later to sell something they especially need.\r\rIf there is a Special button on the System Information screen, tap it to see what the special offer is. You can always refuse, but it is good to know what special thing is available here.\r\rAfter you have examined the system on the System Information screen, if you have cargo, go to the Sell Cargo screen to sell it. Then, switch to the Ship Yard to buy a full tank of fuel, and repair your hull if you think it\'s necessary. If you want, you can let the program take care of the Ship Yard automatically when you arrive in a new system, by checking the appropriate choices in the Options menu.\r\rThen switch to the Short Range Chart to select your next target. Tap any system within the maximum range circle to get information on that system. Try to select a system which hasn\'t got too many pirates (unless to aspire a career as a bounty hunter), and which has a tech level which is opposite the tech level of your current system. That is, from an agricultural system you best travel to an industrial system to sell natural goods, while from an industrial system you best sell technologies to more backward systems. Use the Average Price List button to get an indication on the prices you might expect to sell your goods for. Goods that are displayed bold have an average selling price that is higher than the price you have to pay for those goods in the current system. Note that this isn\'t a guarantee, but it\'s better than nothing.\r\rWhen you have selected a system, you know what you want to sell there, and you can switch to the Buy Cargo screen to get some goods. Remember that Firearms and Narcotics are illegal goods, and you could get in trouble with the police if you traffick those. After having filled your cargo bays, return to the Short Range Chart, and Warp to the selected system.\r\rWhile in flight, flee from pirates, ignore traders and submit to police inspections if they ask you to (unless you are carrying illegal goods, in which case you must decide for yourself how you best handle them). Later on in the game, when you are ready for it, you might wish to become a pirate yourself and attack traders, or become a bounty hunter and attack pirates. However, with full cargo holds you best try to arrive on the target system in one piece, so you can sell your goods and make a profit.\r\rThere are many more things to Space Trader, but you can discover these by examining the screens, reading the help screens, reading the documentation, and simply by playing the game.\r\rHave fun!"

STRING ID EggString "Look up your ship\'s equipment."

STRING ID NoWeaponsString "You either are flying a ship without any weapon slots, so your only option is to flee from fights, or you haven\'t bought any weapons yet. Sorry, no weapons, no attacking."

STRING ID BuyEscapePodString "When your ship has an escape pod, when it is destroyed, you are automatically ejected from it and you will be picked up by the Space Corps after a few days and dropped on a nearby system. You will lose your ship and cargo, but not your life. If you also have taken an insurance on your ship at the bank, the bank will fully refund your ship\'s costs. Your crew will also be saved in their own escape pods, but they will return to their home systems. "

STRING ID EscapePodActivatedString "You have lost your ship and cargo, but your and your crew\'s lives are saved. The Space Corps transports you to the space port of the system where you are currently located. Your crew is returned to their home systems."

STRING ID FleaBuiltString "Your ship has been destroyed, but luckily, you are clever enough to convert your pod into a Flea type of ship, so you can continue your journey, or trade it in for a better ship."

STRING ID InsurancePaysString "The bank pays you the amount your ship was worth, including equipment but excluding the cargo. Note that this is the same amount as you would have got when you would have traded the ship in."

STRING ID TribbleSurvivedString "Don\'t be too sad. They were incredibly annoying, weren\'t they?"

STRING ID AntidoteDestroyedString "The antidote for the Japori system was destroyed with your ship. But they probably have some new antidote in the system where you originally got it."

STRING ID NoEscapePodString "Insurance pays out when you must escape from your ship with an escape pod. Since you don\'t have a pod, you can\'t get insurance."

STRING ID StopInsuranceString "If you stop your insurance, your no-claim will return to 0%, even if you buy new insurance immediately."

STRING ID CantPayInsuranceString "You can\'t leave if you haven\'t paid your insurance. If you have no way to pay, you should stop your insurance at the bank."

STRING ID OutdatedSoftwareString "This version of the software is a beta version, and can\'t be used after a certain date. To get a the latest version, go to http://go.to/spacetrader."

STRING ID PickCannisterString "Your scoops can pick up space debris. If you want the contents of this canister, and you have room in your cargo holds, you can pick it up. If you don\'t have room, you can dump cargo to make room."

STRING ID CurrentShipString "This screen shows your current ship, including equipment. "

STRING ID SellItemString "Selling an item will return to you about 75% of what you first paid for it. If you sell a ship as a whole, all items on it will automatically be sold."

STRING ID SureToFleeOrBribeString "Only when you are carrying illegal goods, the police will do something you don\'t like, so if you aren\'t carrying anything illegal, you usually should just submit, and not try to attack, flee or bribe."

STRING ID SureToSubmitString "If you are carrying illegal goods and the police searches you, they will impound the goods and fine you. You normally don\'t want to let the police search you when you are carrying illegal goods (firearms and narcotics), unless you are afraid they might kill you if you try to do something else."

STRING ID BuyItemString "Tap Yes if you want to buy the item in the title for the price mentioned."

STRING ID QuestsString "This screen lists the quests you are currently on."

STRING ID WormholeOutOfRangeString "The system that owns a wormhole is shown to the left of it. You must first fly to that system, and tap the wormhole from there."

STRING ID CantPayWormholeString "Wormhole tax must be paid when you want to warp through a wormhole. It depends on the type of your ship."

STRING ID SpecificationString "These are the specifications of the costs you have to pay if you are going to warp to the selected target system."

STRING ID SqueekString "This is a cute, furry tribble."

STRING ID TribblesAteNarcoticsString "Tribbles ate your narcotics, and it killed most of them. At least the furs remained."

STRING ID MoonBoughtString "What are you waiting for?"

STRING ID ArtifactStolenString "The aliens have taken the artifact from you. Well, it\'s rightfully theirs, so you probably shouldn\'t complain. You won\'t receive any reward from professor Berger, though."

STRING ID ArtifactNotSavedString "You couldn\'t take the artifact with you in the escape pod, so now it\'s lost in the wreckage. The aliens will probably pick it up there."

STRING ID ShipNotWorthMuchString "Normally you would receive about 75% of the worth of a new ship as trade-in value, but a tribble infested ship will give you only 25%. It is a way to get rid of your tribbles, though."

STRING ID AttackByAccidentString "If you attack the police, they know you are a die-hard criminal and will immediately label you as such."

STRING ID AttackTraderString "While attacking a trader is not considered to be as bad as attacking the police (since no police is present, they cannot judge the exact circumstances of the attack), it will make the police suspicious of you."

STRING ID NoSurrenderString "If you are too big a criminal, surrender is NOT an option anymore."

STRING ID ArrestedString "At least you survived."

STRING ID AntidoteRemovedString "At least those poor people at Japori are assisted. You couldn\'t help them, what with being in prison \'n all."

STRING ID TribblesSoldString "At least you got rid of them."

STRING ID FleaReceivedString "It\'s standard practice for the police to leave a condemned criminal with at least the means to leave the solar system."

STRING ID ConvictionString "Your fine and number of days in prison are based on the kind of criminal you were found to be."

STRING ID ShipSoldString "The Space Corps needs cash to make you pay for the damages you did. Your ship is the only valuable possession you have."

STRING ID InsuranceLostString "Too bad. Your no-claim is reset too."

STRING ID MercenariesLeaveString "You can\'t pay your mercenaries while you are imprisoned, and so they have sought new employment."

STRING ID WantToSurrenderString "Your fine and time in prison will depend on how big a criminal you are. Your fine will be taken from your cash. If you don\'t have enough cash, the police will sell your ship to get it. If you have debts, the police will pay them from your credits (if you have enough) before you go to prison, because otherwise the interest would be staggering."

STRING ID ImpoundString "What would you expect?"

STRING ID WantToSurrenderToAliensString "The aliens are only after the artifact. They will let you live, and even let you keep your cargo, but you won\'t be able to finish your quest."

STRING ID RetireDestroyedUtopiaString "Tap anywhere on the screen to continue..."

STRING ID NoQuartersForJarekString "To be able to take a passenger on board, you must have at least one empty set of crew quarters. That means you can\'t take a passenger on a ship with only one set of quarters, and if you have spare quarters, there can\'t be a mercenary living in them."

STRING ID JarekNeedsQuartersString "There is room for a passenger on your current ship, but not on the ship you intend to buy."

STRING ID JarekTakenHomeString "You can\'t deliver Jarek home yourself now."

STRING ID JarekTakenOnBoardString "Your passenger uses one of your crew quarters, until you have delivered him to his destination."

STRING ID QuestListString "This form lists where all the quests start."

STRING ID FuelCompactorString "A fuel compactor allows you to fill up your tanks so you can travel 18 parsecs. You can\'t buy this anywhere, though you may sell it if you like. If you upgrade ships, you can pay to have the fuel compactor installed in your new ship."

STRING ID DebtWarningString "You get this warning because your debt has exceeded 75000 credits. If you don\'t pay back quickly, you may find yourself stuck in a system with no way to leave. You have been warned."

STRING ID DebtTooLargeForBuyString "Your debt has exceeded 100000 credits. You\'re in big trouble! You cannot buy any cargo. You should have heeded the warnings!"

STRING ID DebtTooLargeForTravelString "Your ship has been chained to the station\'s dock. Your debt has increased to a point where you are no longer a trusted trader. You may not leave until you can reduce it to an acceptable level. You have been warned and should have listened.."

STRING ID TransferFuelCompactorString "For the sum of 20000 credits, you get to keep your unique fuel compactor! This may seem to be a lot of money, but you must remember that this is the exact amount the fuel compactor is currently worth, and it has already been subtracted from the price for which the new ship is offered. So actually, this is a very good deal."

STRING ID TransferLightningShieldString "For the sum of 30000 credits, you get to keep your unique lightning shield! This may seem to be a lot of money, but you must remember that this is the exact amount the shield is currently worth, and it has already been subtracted from the price for which the new ship is offered. So actually, this is a very good deal."

STRING ID FireMercenaryString "If you fire a mercenary, he or she returns to his or her home system."

STRING ID LootMarieCelesteString "The Marie Celeste is completely abandoned, and drifting through space. The ship\'s log is unremarkable except for a Tribble infestation a few months ago, and the note that the last system visited was Lowry.\r\rThe crew\'s quarters are in good shape, with no signs of struggle. There is still food sitting on the table and beer in the mugs in the mess hall. Except for the fact that it\'s abandoned, the ship is normal in every way.\r\rBy Intergalactic Salvage Law, you have the right to claim the cargo as your own if you decide to."

STRING ID TradeCaptainAhabString "Captain Ahab is in need of a spare shield for an upcoming mission. Since he\'s in a rush, he\'d rather not stop to get one on-planet.\r\rThe deal he\'s offering is a trade, rather than cash, for the shield. He\'ll trade you some piloting lessons in exchange for your reflective shield (he only needs one, so if you have more than one, you\'ll keep the others).\r\rCaptain Ahab is one of the greatest pilots of all time, and still holds the speed record for cross-galaxy transport."

STRING ID TrainingString "Under the watchful eye of the Captain, you demonstrate your abilities. The Captain provides some helpful pointers and tips, and teaches you a few new techniques. The few hours pass quickly, but you feel you\'ve gained a lot from the experience."

STRING ID TradeCaptainConradString "Captain Conrad is in need of a military laser to test a new shield design she\'s been working on. Unfortunately, she\'s used up her R&D budget for the year.\r\rThe deal she\'s offering is a trade, rather than cash, for the laser. She\'ll trade you some engineering lessons in exchange for your military laser (she only needs one, so if you have more than one, you\'ll keep the others).\r\rCaptain Conrad, in addition to writing early novels about life in the fleet,  invented practically every component of the modern warp drive."

STRING ID TradeCaptainHuieString "Captain Huie is in need of a military laser for an upcoming mission, but would rather hold onto her cash to buy her cargo.\r\rThe deal she\'s offering is a trade, rather than cash, for the laser. She\'ll give you some secrets of doing business in exchange for your military laser.\r\rCaptain Huie is known far and wide for driving a hard bargain; she was Trade Commissioner of the Galactic Council for over twenty years."

STRING ID DrinkOldTonicString "Floating in orbit, you come across a bottle of Captain Marmoset\'s Amazing Skill Tonic. This concoction has been extremely hard to find since the elusive Captain Marmoset left on a mission to the heart of a comet.\r\rIn the old days, this stuff went for thousands of credits a bottle, since people reported significant gains in their abilities after quaffing a bottle.\r\rThe \"best used by\" date stamped on the bottle has become illegible. The tonic might still be good. Then again, it\'s not clear what happens when the Tonic breaks down..."

STRING ID DrankGoodSkillTonicString "Captain Marmoset\'s Amazing Skill Tonic goes down very smoothly. You feel a slight tingling in your fingertips. "

STRING ID DrankOldSkillTonicString "Captain Marmoset\'s Amazing Skill Tonic tasted very strange, like slightly salty red wine. You feel a bit dizzy, and your teeth itch for a while. "

STRING ID BuyPaperString "The local newspaper is a great way to find out what\'s going on in the area.\r\rYou may find out about shortages, wars, or other situations at nearby systems. Then again, some will tell you that \"no news is good news.\""

STRING ID CantBuyNewspaperString "If you can\'t pay the price of a newspaper, you can\'t get it. If you have \"Reserve Money\" checked in the Options menu, the game will reserve at least enough money to pay for insurance and mercenaries."

STRING ID DumpItemString "On the Dump Cargo screen, the leftmost button shows the number of cargo bays you have which contain these goods. If that amount is zero, you can\'t dump any."

STRING ID Options2String "\"Always pay for newspaper\" will allow you to automatically pay when you click on the \"News\" button when viewing system information. If you leave this unchecked, you will be asked whether you want to spend the money on the paper.\r\r\"Enable use of hardware buttons\" permits the use of the hardware buttons for changing screens when docked. The order is just like the rectangular navigation buttons at the top right:\rThe Calendar button takes you to the Buy Cargo screen.\rThe Address Book button takes you to the Sell Cargo screen.\rThe To-Do List button takes you to the Ship Yard screen.\rThe Memo Pad button takes you to the Short Range chart.\r\r\"Show range to tracked system\" determines whether or not the Short Range Chart will display the distance to a tracked system. You can track a system by double-clicking it in the Galactic Chart, or by clicking the \"Track this system\" checkbox when you find a system on the Galactic Chart.\r\r\"Stop tracking systems on arrival\" allows you to automatically stop tracking a system when you arrive at that system. If you uncheck this, you will continue to track the system until you turn off system tracking or select a different system to track in the Galactic Chart.\r\r\"Textual encounters\", when checked, shows encounters as text instead of as ship pictures. This gives a bit more information but doesn\'t look as good.\r\rChecking \"Remind about loans\" will provide you with notification of your current loan balance every five days.\r\r\"Identify at startup\" shows the name of the current commander when Space Trader is started. This is useful when playing two switched games.\r\r\"Copy prefs from parallel game\", if checked, when you switch to this game, will copy the preferences from the parallel game. One person playing two parallel games on a Palm will usually have this turned on (an exception might be where the player is a pirate in one game but a lawful trader in the other). Two persons sharing a Palm playing parallel games will want this turned off. Note that you must turn copying of preferences off separately for each game. It is entirely possible for one game not to copy preferences from the other game, but have its own preferences copied to the other game."

STRING ID DumpCargoString "Use this screen to jettison unwanted cargo. The leftmost column shows quantities you have stored in your cargo holds. The second column shows the name of the goods. To dump it, either tap the quantity cell, after which you can specify how much you want to dump, or tap the \"Max\" cell, which will automatically jettison all goods you own of the selected item. \r\rIt should be obvious that it\'s better to sell cargo than to dump it. When you dump cargo, you don\'t get paid! But sometimes, particularly when you need to get rid of illegal cargo on a planet with no trade in that kind of goods, it makes sense to just dump it at a loss."

STRING ID WildArrestedString "Jonathan Wild is arrested, and taken off to prison."

STRING ID WildSwitchesShipsString "Jonathan Wild figures that it\'s probably safer to get a ride home with his old associate than stay on your ship. After all, if you surrender to pirates, what\'s to stop you from surrendering to the police?"

STRING ID WildStaysAboardString "Jonathan Wild would have preferred to get a ride home with his old associate than stay in your ship. After all, if you surrender to pirates, what\'s to stop you from surrendering to the police? But the Pirates have no quarters available, so he grudgingly stays aboard your ship."

STRING ID WildLeavesString "Since Jonathan Wild is not willing to travel under these conditions, and you\'re not willing to change the situation, he leaves you and goes into hiding on this system."

STRING ID WildWontGoString "Jonathan Wild is being hunted by the police. They\'re serious about capturing him, and he doesn\'t wish to be captured. He\'d rather take his chances hiding out on this system than facing swarms of police without any weapons."

STRING ID ReactorUsingFuelString "The Reactor was unstable to begin with. Now, it seems that it\'s rapidly consuming fuel. It is not clear what will happen if it runs out -- but you have no reason to suspect it will be anything good."

STRING ID ReactorSelfDestructString "The Reactor has undergone unplanned energetic self-disassembly."

STRING ID ReactorOnBoardString "You can\'t use the five cargo bays containing the reactor until you have visited the Nix system and delivered it there. The ten bays containing reactor fuel cannot be used while they contain fuel, but as the reactor consumes the fuel, the bays become available. Note that you can\'t even empty bays by selling your ship."

STRING ID MorganLaserInstallString "Henry Morgan\'s Special Laser is a more powerful version of the Military laser. It uses advanced thermal coherence, which should be as effective on titanium as it is on organic material.  This laser can be sold, but there is no way to get another one if you do, since only Henry Morgan knows how to make them (and he would be as likely to kill you as he would sell you another)."

STRING ID ReactorTakenString "The bad news is that you\'ve lost the Ion Reactor. The good news is that you no longer have to worry about managing its depleting fuel store."

STRING ID ReactorNotTakenString "The good news is that you still have the Ion Reactor. The bad news is that you still have to worry about managing its depleting fuel store."

STRING ID CantTransferString "When trading ships, you will only be able to transfer an item from your old ship to the new ship if there is capacity for that item on the new ship,"

STRING ID TransferMorgansLaserString "For the sum of 33333 credits, you get to keep the laser given to you by Henry Morgan! This may seem to be a lot of money, but you must remember that this is the exact amount the laser is currently worth, and it has already been subtracted from the price for which the new ship is offered. So actually, this is a very good deal."

STRING ID CantTransferAllString "The ship\'s price takes into account the trade-in value of your current ship. You have to pay the remaining price, and the price of transferring your unique equipment, with your cash total. If you can\'t afford to transfer all of your unique equipment, you can choose which items to transfer. If you have \"Reserve Money\" checked in the Options menu, the game will reserve at least enough money to pay for insurance and mercenaries."

STRING ID TribbleNoticeString "You might want to do something about those Tribbles..."

STRING ID CantSellShipWithReactorString "You can\'t sell your ship as long as you have an Ion Reactor on board. Deliver the Reactor to Nix, and then you\'ll be able to get a new ship."

STRING ID IrradiatedTribblesString "Radiation poisoning seems particularly effective in killing Tribbles. Unfortunately, their fur falls out when they\'re irradiated, so you can\'t salvage anything to sell."

STRING ID WildWontGoWithReactorString "The Ion Reactor is known to be unstable, and Jonathan Wild is trying to get to safety. He\'s not willing to get on the ship while the Reactor\'s on board."

STRING ID NewspaperHelpString "The local newspaper gives you information about what\'s happening on this and nearby systems. On higher-tech systems, you\'ll probably get better news about neighboring systems than you would on a low-tech system."

STRING ID TrackSystemString "Tracking a system will modify the Short Range Chart by adding an arrow pointing in the direction of the system being tracked. If you have selected the \"Show range to tracked system\" option (on Options Page 2), the Short Range Chart will also show you the distance to the system being tracked."

STRING ID DumpAllString "You have opted to jettison all goods you own of this particular type. You don\'t get paid for cargo that you dump! Sometimes, particularly when you need to get rid of illegal cargo on a planet with no trade in them, it makes sense to just dump goods at a loss."

STRING ID FleePostMarieString "Even if you get away, the Customs Police know that you\'ve engaged in criminal activity, and your police record will reflect this fact."

STRING ID CustomsPoliceConfiscatedString "The Customs Police took all the illegal goods from your ship, and sent you on your way. "

STRING ID QuestDragonflyDestroyedString "Hello, Commander. This is Colonel Jackson again. On behalf of the Space Corps, I thank you for your valuable assistance in destroying the Dragonfly. As a reward, we will install one of the experimental shields on your ship. Return here for that when you\'re ready."

STRING ID QuestLightningShipString "A ship with shields that seemed to be like lightning recently fought many other ships in our system. I have never seen anything like it before. After it left, I heard it went to the Regulas system."

STRING ID QuestMonsterKilledString "We thank you for destroying the space monster that circled our system for so long. Please accept 15000 credits as reward for your heroic deed."

STRING ID QuestRetirementString "Welcome to the Utopia system. Your own moon is available for you to retire to it, if you feel inclined to do that. Are you ready to retire and lead a happy, peaceful, and wealthy life?"

STRING ID QuestSkillIncreaseString "An alien with a fast-learning machine offers to increase one of your skills for the reasonable sum of 3000 credits. You won\'t be able to pick that skill, though. Do you accept his offer?"

STRING ID QuestEraseRecordString "A hacker conveys to you that he has cracked the passwords to the galaxy-wide police computer network, and that he can erase your police record for the sum of 5000 credits. Do you want him to do that?"

STRING ID QuestSpaceMonsterString "A space monster has invaded the Acamar system and is disturbing the trade routes. You\'ll be rewarded handsomely if you manage to destroy it."

STRING ID QuestCargoForSaleString "A trader in second-hand goods offers you 3 sealed cargo canisters for the sum of 1000 credits. It could be a good deal: they could contain robots. Then again, it might just be water. Do you want the canisters?"

STRING ID QuestJaporiDiseaseString "A strange disease has invaded the Japori system. We would like you to deliver these ten canisters of special antidote to Japori. Note that, if you accept, ten of your cargo bays will remain in use on your way to Japori. Do you accept this mission?"

STRING ID QuestArtifactDeliveryString "This is professor Berger. I thank you for delivering the alien artifact to me. I hope the aliens weren\'t too much of a nuisance. I have transferred 20000 credits to your account, which I assume compensates for your troubles."

STRING ID QuestAmbassadorJarekString "A recent change in the political climate of this solar system has forced ambassador Jarek to flee back to his home system, Devidia. Would you be willing to give him a lift?"

STRING ID QuestGemulonInvadedString "Alas, Gemulon has been invaded by aliens, which has thrown us back to pre-agricultural times. If only we had known the exact coordinates where they first arrived at our system, we might have prevented this tragedy from happening."

STRING ID QuestDangerousExperimentString "While reviewing the plans for Dr. Fehler\'s new space-warping drive, Dr. Lowenstam discovered a critical error. If you don\'t go to Daled and stop the experiment within ten days, the time-space continuum itself could be damaged!"

STRING ID QuestMorgansReactorString "Galactic criminal Henry Morgan wants this illegal ion reactor delivered to Nix. It\'s a very dangerous mission! The reactor and its fuel are bulky, taking up 15 bays. Worse, it\'s not stable -- its resonant energy will weaken your shields and hull strength while it\'s aboard your ship. Are you willing to deliver it?"

STRING ID QuestScarabStolenString "Captain Renwick developed a new organic hull material for his ship which cannot be damaged except by Pulse lasers. While he was celebrating this success, pirates boarded and stole the craft, which they have named the Scarab. Rumors suggest it\'s being hidden at the exit to a wormhole. Destroy the ship for a reward!"

STRING ID QuestWeirdShipString "A small ship of a weird design docked here recently for repairs. The engineer who worked on it said that it had a weak hull, but incredibly strong shields. I heard it took off in the direction of the Melina system."

STRING ID QuestStrangeShipString "A small ship with shields like I have never seen before was here a few days ago. It destroyed at least ten police ships! Last thing I heard was that it went to the Zalkon system."

STRING ID QuestMedicineDeliveredString "Thank you for delivering the medicine to us. We don\'t have any money to reward you, but we do have an alien fast-learning machine with which we will increase your skills."

STRING ID QuestMoonForSaleString "There is a small but habitable moon for sale in the Utopia system, for the very reasonable sum of half a million credits. If you accept it, you can retire to it and live a peaceful, happy, and wealthy life. Do you wish to buy it?"

STRING ID QuestMerchantPrinceString "A merchant prince offers you a very special and wondrous item for the sum of 1000 credits. Do you accept?"

STRING ID QuestTribbleBuyerString "An eccentric alien billionaire wants to buy your collection of tribbles and offers half a credit for each of them. Do you accept his offer?"

STRING ID QuestDragonflyString "This is colonel Jackson of the Space Corps. An experimental ship, code-named \"Dragonfly\", has been stolen. It is equipped with very special, almost indestructible shields. It shouldn\'t fall into the wrong hands and we will reward you if you destroy it. It has been last seen in the Baratas system."

STRING ID QuestLightningShieldString "Colonel Jackson here. Do you want us to install a lightning shield on your current ship?"

STRING ID QuestLotteryWinnerString "You are lucky! While docking on the space port, you receive a message that you won 1000 credits in a lottery. The prize had been added to your account."

STRING ID QuestAlienArtifactString "This alien artifact should be delivered to professor Berger, who is currently traveling. You can probably find him at a hi-tech solar system. The alien race which produced this artifact seems keen on getting it back, however, and may hinder the carrier. Are you, for a price, willing to deliver it?"

STRING ID QuestAlienInvasionString "We received word that aliens will invade Gemulon seven days from now. We know exactly at which coordinates they will arrive, but we can\'t warn Gemulon because an ion storm disturbs all forms of communication. We need someone, anyone, to deliver this info to Gemulon within six days."

STRING ID QuestFuelCompactorString "Do you wish us to install the fuel compactor on your current ship? (You need a free gadget slot)"

STRING ID QuestJonathanWildString "Law Enforcement is closing in on notorious criminal kingpin Jonathan Wild. He would reward you handsomely for smuggling him home to Kravat. You\'d have to avoid capture by the Police on the way. Are you willing to give him a berth?"

STRING ID QuestInstallMorgansLaserString "Morgan\'s technicians are standing by with something that looks a lot like a military laser -- if you ignore the additional cooling vents and anodized ducts. Do you want them to install Morgan\'s special laser?"

STRING ID QuestScarabDestroyedString "Space Corps is indebted to you for destroying the Scarab and the pirates who stole it. As a reward, we can have Captain Renwick upgrade the hull of your ship. Note that his upgrades won\'t be transferable if you buy a new ship! Come back with the ship you wish to upgrade."

STRING ID QuestUpgradeHullString "The organic hull used in the Scarab is still not ready for day-to-day use. But Captain Renwick can certainly upgrade your hull with some of his retrofit technology. It\'s light stuff, and won\'t reduce your ship\'s range. Should he upgrade your ship?"

STRING ID QuestJarekGetsOutString "Ambassador Jarek is very grateful to you for delivering him back to Devidia. As a reward, he gives you an experimental handheld haggling computer, which allows you to gain larger discounts when purchasing goods and equipment."

STRING ID QuestReactorDeliveredString "Henry Morgan takes delivery of the reactor with great glee. His men immediately set about stabilizing the fuel system. As a reward, Morgan offers you a special, high-powered laser that he designed. Return with an empty weapon slot when you want them to install it."

STRING ID QuestDisasterAvertedString "Upon your warning, Dr. Fehler calls off the experiment. As your  reward, you are given a Portable Singularity. This device will, for one time only, instantaneously transport you to any system in the galaxy. The Singularity can be accessed  by clicking the \"J\" (Jump) button on the Galactic Chart."

STRING ID QuestGemulonRescuedString "This information of the arrival of the alien invasion force allows us to prepare a defense. You have saved our way of life. As a reward, we have a fuel compactor gadget for you, which allows you to travel 18 parsecs with any ship. Return here to get it installed."

STRING ID QuestWildGetsOutString "Jonathan Wild is most grateful to you for spiriting him to safety. As a reward, he has one of his Cyber Criminals hack into the Police Database, and clean up your record. He also offers you the opportunity to take his talented nephew Zeethibal along as a Mercenary with no pay."

STRING ID QuestExperimentFailedString "Dr. Fehler can\'t understand why the experiment failed. But the failure has had a dramatic and disastrous effect on the fabric of space-time itself. It seems that Dr. Fehler won\'t be getting tenure any time soon... and you may have trouble when you warp!"

STRING ID HullReinforcedString "Technicians spent the day replacing welds and bolts, and adding materials to your ship. When they\'re done, they tell you your ship should be significantly sturdier."

STRING ID TradeInOrbitString "If you are selling items, specify the amount to sell and tap the OK button. If you specify more than you have in your cargo bays, the maximum possible amount will be sold. The same goes if you tap the All button. If you don\'t want to sell anything, tap the None button.\r\rIf you are buying items, specify the amount to buy and tap the OK button. If you specify more than you can afford, or more than your available cargo bays, the maximum possible amount will be bought. The same goes if you tap the All button. If you don\'t want to buy anything, tap the None button.\r"

STRING ID MarieCantBribeString "Certain governments have such an incorruptible police force that you can\'t bribe them. Other times, the police are corruptible, but their supervisors know what\'s going on, so they won\'t risk it."

STRING ID AttackGreatCaptainString "You grew up on stories of the adventures of the Great Captains. You heard how they explored the galaxy, invented technologies ... and destroyed man, many pirates and villains in combat. Are you sure you want to attack one of these greats?"

STRING ID ErrGraphicsSupportString "There are four versions of Space Trader:\r\r1) SpaceTrader_black&white.prc contains 1-bit graphics and can run on any Palm with OS version 2.0 or higher.\r2) SpaceTrader_gray.prc contains 4-bit grayscale graphics and needs at least Palm OS 3.5 and hardware that supports 4-bit grayscales.\r3) SpaceTrader_color.prc contains 8-bit color graphics and needs at least Palm OS 3.5 and hardware that supports colors.\r4) SpaceTrader_hicolor contains 16-bit color graphics and needs at least Palm OS 4.0 and hardware that supports colors.\r\rGet the right version for your Palm."

STRING ID LoanReminderString "The Bank Officer will contact you every five days to remind you of your debt. You can turn off these warnings on the second page of Game Options."

STRING ID SingularityString "To use the Portable Singularity in the Galactic Chart, select your destination system by tracking it, then Jump by clicking  the \"J\" button. Voila! You will travel through the Singularity and arrive instananeously at your destination."

STRING ID NoDumpNoScoopString "If you wanted to pick up the floating canister, you had to dump something from your cargo holds."

STRING ID CannotSaveString "There was an error trying to create the savegame file. This may be due to a lack of system resources."

STRING ID CannotLoadString "No savegame file was found to load. You must first create a savegame file with the menu choice \"Save game\"."

STRING ID ReallyLoadString "Loading a savegame will remove your current game from memory and restore an earlier situation."

STRING ID DisableScoringString "Only a game played without loading previously saved games will be taken into account for the high score table. So you can load a game, but you won\'t score anymore, until you start a new game."

STRING ID GameSavedString "Snapshots are meant for debugging purposes. If you notice a bug and contact the game\'s author, he might ask you for a snapshot of the current game which allows him to recreate the bug, or notice any strange things in the memory. Snapshots have no use in playing Space Trader."

STRING ID ShortcutPrefsString "On this page you can set your preferences for the rectangularshortcut buttons used when you\'re in the dock.\r\rUse the pulldowns to assign the function to each navigation button. Shortcut 1 is the leftmost shortcut, while Shortcut 4 is the rightmost."

STRING ID SpaceLitteringString "Space litterers will at least be considered dubious. If you are already a dubious character, space littering will only add to your list of offences. However, the police must of course be able to track the litter to you, which they often are not."

STRING ID SwitchGameString "You can play two parallel games of Space Trader on your Palm. You switch between them by using the \"Switch Game\" option. This allows you to try two different styles of gameplay at the same time (for instance as a pirate and as an honest trader), or two people to play their own Space Trader game on one Palm. It\'s best to name the Commander in the two games differently, so you can easily recognize which game is loaded."

STRING ID CannotSwitchString "Switching to a parallel game failed. This is usually due to a lack of space on your Palm."

STRING ID SwitchedString "A parallel game has been loaded. You can switch back to the previous game by using the option \"Switch Game\" again."

STRING ID SwitchToNewString "You can play two parallel games on a Palm. You can switch between them with the \"Switch Game\" function. You best give the commander in each of the games a different name, which makes it easier to recognize them."

STRING ID HelpOnMenuString "The menu consists of three main menu choices:\r\r\"Command\" allows you to issue commands while you are docked at a system. You can use this to switch between the main screens.\r\"Game\" gives access to game functions. These are explained in depth below.\r\"Help\" gives access to help information.\r\rThe functions in the \"Game\" menu probably need more in depth information:\r\r\"New Game\" starts a new game, without further ado.\r\"Switch Game\" switches to a parallel game. You can play two different games in parallel on a Palm, which is handy for people who are sharing a Palm.\r\"Retire\" ends the game by retiring the commander. Your score is calculated and you can enter the high-score table if you qualify. However, the preferred way to end a game is by claiming a moon, which is something you have to work for.\r\"Options\" gives access to the game preferences.\r\"Shortcuts\" allows you to set new preferences for the four shortcut buttons in the top right corner of many screens.\r\"High Scores\" shows the high-score list.\r\"Clear High Scores\" wipes the current high-score list.\r\"Snapshot\" saves an image  of your current game state. You will not ordinarily have any use for this unless you are helping us track down a bug: in this case, we\'ll ask you to send a copy of this image so we can figure out what\'s going on."

STRING ID IdentifyStartupString "This information box shows the name of the commander playing the current game. This is useful if two switched games are played in parallel. You can turn this notification off in the Options."

STRING ID RectangularButtonsOnString "Space Trader by default uses rectangular buttons for shortcuts and on several screens. Before the release of Palm OS 5.0 it was possible to change the frame of a button from rounded into rectangular by directly accessing the frame attribute of a button. PalmSource has warned developers that this feature might no longer work in Palm OS 5.0 and higher, and they do not offer an easy replacement feature. When this version of Space Trader was released, it was unknown whether buttons could still be made rectangular under Palm OS 5.0, since it wasn\'t out yet. Therefore it was turned off by default, but you can try to turn it on by choosing Yes when answering the \"Rectangular Buttons\" question. If it does NOT work, anything might happen, from crashing the game to corrupted buttons, to the Palm refusing to execute this action. If the game crashes, your setting won\'t be saved and the next time you start it you will have rounded buttons again. If it doesn\'t work right but doesn\'t crash, you can turn it off again from the Options. Otherwise, stick with it because rectangular buttons look better. Hopefully by the time Space Trader 1.2.1 appears it will be known how to approach this issue for OS 5.0, and a permanent fix will be made."

STRING ID AttemptRectangularString "After you leave the Options, if the current game screen shown contains buttons that normally are rectangular, the change will be visible when you leave the screen and come back to it later."

STRING ID NoJumpToCurSystemString "Track another system than the one where you are currently are located, then tap the Singularity button to jump."
