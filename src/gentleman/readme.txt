GentleMan is a file manager for PalmOS. It can handle every VFS storage medium
supported by PalmOS. It also has a smart plugin system to handle files with a
certain filename extension (like playback plugin for .wav files). It is 
optimized for the HandEra 330 and it used some special Sony Clie features.
