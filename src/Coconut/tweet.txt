Weird. A TRS-Color emulator developed for #PalmOS back in 2003,
now compiled and running natively on Linux/x86.

I found links to FileZ and SpaceTrader source code via palmopensource.com.
But links there are dying fast, and I do not expect palmsource.com to be
up and running much longer.

If you developed for #PalmOS back in the day, please consider
donating your source code. Let's make those apps alive again!
